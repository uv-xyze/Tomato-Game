# TOMATO GAME - Yuvani Haupe Liyanage

I have successfully implemented the Tomato API to create the Tomato Game, incorporating four fundamental software design principles: low coupling and high cohesion, event-driven programming, interoperability, and virtual identity. The architecture of the game reflects a well-structured and modular design, minimizing dependencies between components (low coupling) and ensuring that related functionalities are grouped together (high cohesion). The game leverages event-driven programming, allowing seamless interaction between various game elements and providing a dynamic user experience. Interoperability has been a key focus, ensuring compatibility with different systems and technologies. Additionally, virtual identity principles have been employed to manage user sessions and maintain a consistent user experience. This holistic approach to software design enhances the game's maintainability, scalability, and overall robustness.
